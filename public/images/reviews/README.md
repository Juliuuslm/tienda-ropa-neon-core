# Reviews Section Images

## Note
The Reviews section does NOT require images. Reviews are displayed as text cards with:
- User avatar (first letter of username in a colored box)
- Username
- Role/Status
- Review text
- Star rating
- Random ID number

## If You Want to Add User Avatars
You can extend the component to include optional user avatar images:

### User Avatars (Optional)
- **Filename**: `avatar-[username].jpg`
- **Dimensions**: 48x48px (small square)
- **Purpose**: User profile picture
- **Current Implementation**: Colored box with first letter (no image needed)

## Current Reviewers
1. KAI_ZEN - Netrunner
2. V0ID_WALKER - Urban Explorer
3. NEON_GHOST - Digital Artist

## Notes
- Currently using letter initials instead of images (works well for the design)
- Can add avatars later if needed
- Reviews have hover animations (lift effect)
